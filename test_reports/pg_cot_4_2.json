I contribute 15.", "In the first two rounds, Player A and Player C have consistently contributed more than I have. If they continue to do this in the following rounds, they will gain more points from the communal pool. However, if I increase my contribution too much, I may end up with fewer points.\n\nI need to make my decision based on the likelihood of their contributions. Since Player A and Player C have shown a tendency to contribute more, I will slightly increase my contribution in the hope of gaining a larger share of the communal pool while still keeping my remaining points high.\n\nTherefore, I decide that in the third round \"I contribute 25\".", "Considering the previous moves, Player A tends to contribute higher amounts, while Player B's contributions have slightly decreased in the second round but increased in the third. The average contribution of Player A is 25 and Player B is 20 so far. \n\nIn order to win, I should ensure a high return from the communal pool, but also contribute the least. So, I need to maintain my contribution to a level slightly higher than the average to win. \n\nTherefore, \"I contribute 22\".", "First, let's analyze the contributions so far:\n\n- Player A: 20+30+25+35 = 110\n- Player B (you): 20+15+25+22 = 82\n- Player C: 0 (has not yet played)\n\nThe communal pool is 110 (from Player A) + 82 (from you) = 192 points. Let's assume Player C will not contribute anything in this final round, which seems likely given their past behavior. If you contribute nothing, the communal pool stays at 192 points. This is multiplied by 5 (960) and then divided equally among all players (320 each). Therefore, the total points for each player would be:\n\n- Player A: 100 (initial points) - 110 (contributions) + 320 (communal repayment) = 310\n- Player B (you): 100 - 82 + 320 = 338\n- Player C: 100 + 320 = 420\n\nIn this scenario, even if you contribute nothing, you would still come in second place. However, to beat Player C, you must invest more wisely and efficiently, keeping in mind that Player C has not contributed anything so far. \n\nLet's assume you need to beat Player C by at least 1 point. Below is the calculation for the points needed from the communal pool.\n\nPlayer C points: 420 (existing points) - your points without contributing in last round: 338 = 82. Therefore, you need 82 points from last round contribution. Considering the communal pool will be divided by 3 players with a multiplication of 5, you should contribute at least 83/5 = 16.6, which rounds to 17. \n\nThus, your decision for the final round should be: \"I contribute 17\". This will ensure you end the game with the highest points."]}, "Player C": {"score": 578, "moves": [20, 20, 25, 27, 28], "text_moves": ["I contribute 20.", "I contribute 20.", "I contribute 25.", "I contribute 27.", "I contribute 28."]}, "agents": ["Player A", "Player B", "Player C"], "n_rounds": 5}
