Assuming Player C contributed the same as well, the communal pool had 60 points in total. After multiplying it by 5, it comes to 300 points. Dividing it evenly among all players, everyone received 100 points, leading to no net gain or loss.\n\nBy analyzing this, I anticipate that all players might contribute the same amount in this round as well. However, to increase my gain, I should contribute slightly less. This way, I can keep some points for myself while relying on others' contributions to the communal pool.\n\nUsing this strategy, \"I contribute 15\".", "Given the previous rounds and my goal to invest the least to win, I am choosing to contribute less in this round. In the first round, I contributed 20 points like Player A, then decreased my contribution to 15 in the second round, 5 points less than Player A. Since we only know what Player A has invested so far, and given that their investments have increased, I assume they might continue this trend. \n\nAs a strategic move, it might be best for me to decrease my contribution further but still contribute something to continue to benefit from the communal pool. Therefore, considering all these factors, I should contribute less than my previous investment of 15 but enough to benefit from the pool.\n\n\"I contribute 10\"", "In the previous rounds, Player A consistently contributed more than you did and Player C contributed less. Considering this pattern might continue for the next round, you might want to slightly increase your contribution, but still keep it less than Player A's.\n\nBy doing so, you expect to earn a higher share from the communal pool than in the previous rounds, as well as maintain a good amount of points. Therefore, I suggest contributing around 18 monetary points.\n\nSo, you could say: \"I contribute 18.\"", "First, let's calculate the total contributions so far:\n\nPlayer A: 20 + 22 + 18 + 17 = 77\nPlayer B (me): 20 + 15 + 10 + 18 = 63\nPlayer C:\n\nI don't know the contributions of Player C, but let's assume they're contributing a similar amount to me. \n\nLet's assume for round 5, Player A contributes 19 (similar to their previous contributions), Player C contributes 15 (assuming they're playing similarly to me), and I need to decide my contribution. \n\nTotal contributions in round 5 would be: 19 (A) + 15 (C) + X (my contribution). This total will be multiplied by 5 and then divided by 3 (number of players). \n\nTo minimize my contribution while maximizing my final points, I need to consider:\n\n- The previous contributions and possible next move of the other players;\n- The balance between my remaining points and the possible return from the communal pool. \n\nLet's assume that I contribute 20 in the final round. The total contribution would be 19 (A) + 15 (C) + 20 (B) = 54. After multiplying by 5 and dividing by 3, each player would receive about 90 points from the communal pool.\n\nMy final points would be: 100 (initial points) - 63 (previous contributions) - 20 (this round contribution) + 90 (return from communal pool) = 107 points.\n\nMeanwhile, Player A would end up with: 100 - 77 - 19 + 90 = 94 points. \n\nAnd Player C would end up with a similar amount to me, depending on their actual contributions. \n\nTherefore, if I contribute 20 in this round, I have a good chance of winning, assuming Player C doesn't contribute significantly more than expected.
