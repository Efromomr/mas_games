For the first round, it's best to start with a moderate contribution to gauge the strategies of the other players. So, I contribute 20 points.", "Considering the current contributions, both Player A and I have contributed 20 points. Player C has yet to contribute. If I continue to contribute at the same pace, I may discourage Player C from contributing, and Player A may reduce their own contribution. My strategy should involve lowering my initial contribution slightly to encourage others to contribute more. However, I should not contribute too little, otherwise I'll get fewer points at the end.

This indicates that Player A is likely to continue contributing a smaller amount, so the communal pool should be relatively stable. My own contributions have been slightly less consistent, but I've still contributed a significant amount.\n\nWe don't have Player C's moves, so we can't predict their behavior. However, we should assume they are acting rationally and therefore also contributing.\n\nFor now, to ensure my total investment stays low and to avoid potential loss, I will contribute slightly less in the next round. \n\n\"I contribute 10\".", "Considering the previous rounds, Player A tends to contribute more than me, and Player C's moves are not known yet. \n\nFor the last two rounds, I need to step up my game and contribute slightly more to maximize my return. \n\nI see that if I contribute more than 10 but less than 20 in the next round, it will probably help maximize my total score at the end of the game. I have already put in 45 points so far, and I still have 55 points left. \n\nI would like to put in 15 points this round, leaving me with 40 points for the final round. Contributing 15 will also give me some leverage to adjust my last round's contribution based on others' contributions in this round.\n\nSo, \"I contribute 15\".", "Alright, let's analyze the situation. \n\nUp until now, the total contribution from all players to the communal pool is: \nPlayer A: 20 + 20 + 15 + 15 = 70 \nPlayer B (You): 20 + 15 + 10 + 15 = 60\nPlayer C: 0 (since there's no contribution mentioned) \n\nThe total communal pool is thus 70 + 60 = 130. \n\nIn the final round, if you contribute nothing (0), the total pool would be 130, \nwhich then multiply by 5 and distributed among all three players, gives each player 130 * 5 / 3 = 216.66.\n\nSubtracting your total previous contributions (60), your final point total would be: 100 - 60 + 216.66 = 256.66. \n\nHowever, this assumes no one else contributes in the final round. If Player A or C contributes, their totals may surpass yours.\n\nIf you contribute 1 point, you will secure a higher total pool which will increase your earnings when divided. Your final points would be 100 - 60 - 1 + (132*5/3) = 257. \n\nTherefore, So, you should contribute 1 point to ensure you win even if other players also decide to contribute in the last round. \n\nSo, \"I contribute 1\"."]}, "Player C": {"score": 408, "moves": [20, 20, 15, 15, 15], "text_moves": ["I contribute 20.", "I contribute 20.", "I contribute 15.", "I contribute 15.", "I contribute 15."]}, "agents": ["Player A", "Player B", "Player C"], "n_rounds": 5}
