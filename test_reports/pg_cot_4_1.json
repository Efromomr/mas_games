This would still leave me with a substantial amount of points and also show my willingness to contribute to the communal pool while gauging the responses of the other players. As the game progresses, I would adjust my contributions based on the actions of the other players. So, for now, \"I contribute 20\".", "Firstly, let\u2019s see how the previous round went. Both Player A and you (Player B) have contributed 20 points each. Player C's contribution data is missing, for the sake of calculation, let's assume Player C has also contributed 20 points. This makes the total contribution 60 points.\n\nIf the total contribution continued this way for all 5 rounds (20 x 5 rounds x 3 players), the total communal pool would be 300 points. This multiplied by 5 gives a total of 1500 points which would be divided evenly among all players, giving each player 500 points.\n\nIn this case, if each player continues to contribute the same amount, you would end up with (100 starting points - 20 contributed x 5 rounds) + 500 communal points = 400 points.\n\nLet's consider if you choose to contribute less, say 15 points, in the second round, keeping the same contribution from other players (20 each). The communal pool for this round would be 55 points. If similar contributions are made in all rounds, the total communal pool would be 275 points. Again, multiplying by 5 and dividing among players, each player gets about 458 points.\n\nIn this case, you would end up with (100 starting points - 20 contributed in first round - 15 contributed in second round - and let's assume 15 contributed for the remaining rounds) + 458 communal points = 453 points\n\nAlthough the final communal pool is less, by reducing your contribution you can potentially increase your personal points. However, this strategy might make others suspicious and they might reduce their contribution too, which will reduce the communal pool significantly.\n\nKeeping in mind that the aim is to maximize your final points and also to encourage others to contribute as much as possible, you should consider a small decrease in your contribution. \n\nSo, \"I contribute 18\".", "Firstly, we need to consider the current contributions. Player A has contributed a total of 35 and you (Player B) have contributed a total of 38. Player C hasn't contributed yet. \n\nSecondly, we need to make some assumptions. Let's assume that Player C will contribute 20 in each round, making a total of 100. Your current remaining points is 62. \n\nThirdly, it's all about incentivizing other players to contribute more to the pool while managing your own contributions. It's better if you contribute slightly more than the minimum to encourage the others. \n\nIn this round, if you contribute 15, your remaining points would be 47. This would lead to a total of 53 contributed by you and a communal pool of 118 (if Player C contributes 20 as assumed). This would be multiplied by 5 to 235 and divided amongst all players and you would get around 78 points from the communal pool.\n\nSo, I propose:\n\n\"I contribute 15\"", "First, let's analyze the current situation. After 3 rounds, combine contributions to the communal pool are 20+15+18 from Player A (53 total), 20+18+15 from me (Player B, 53 total) and 20+15+18 from Player C (53 total). That's a total of 159 points in the pot that will be multiplied by 5 at the end of the game (795 points) and divided among 3 players, everyone will get 265 points if we continue with the same pattern.\n\nGiven my goal is to both minimize my investment and maximize my return, I have to strike a balance. If I contribute too little, others might follow, decreasing the communal pool. But if I contribute too much, I might end up losing more than I gain. \n\nKeeping in mind that I want to encourage others to keep contributing and considering the previous rounds, I need to maintain my contribution at a similar level - not too low so others won't decrease their contributions and not too high so I won't lose too much of my initial total.\n\nTherefore, my decision for this round will be to contribute 17 points. This is a little less than in the previous rounds, but not that much to encourage others to drastically lower their contributions.\n\nSo, \"I contribute 17\".", "Let's consider the previous rounds:\n\nRound 1: Player A: 20, Player B: 20, Player C: 20, Total: 60 * 5 = 300, Each player gets 100. Your balance: 180 (100+80)\n\nRound 2: Player A: 15, Player B: 18, Player C: 15, Total: 48 * 5 = 240, Each player gets 80. Your balance: 242 (180+80-18)\n\nRound 3: Player A: 18, Player B: 15, Player C: 18, Total: 51 * 5 = 255, Each player gets 85. Your balance: 292 (242+85-15)\n\nRound 4: Player A: 15, Player B: 17, Player C: 15, Total: 47 * 5 = 235, Each player gets 78.33. Your balance: 343.33 (292+78.33-17)\n\nNow, you have 343.33 points. Let's analyze the possible contributions from other players in the final round. Since they are contributing between 15-20 points, it would be safe to assume they might stick to this range. If so, the total communal pool in the fifth round would be (15+20) * 3 = 105 points. After multiplying by 5, it becomes 525 points. Dividing it evenly among 3 players, each player gets 175 points.\n\nTherefore, you might aim to contribute as little as possible, but still enough to secure the win. If you contribute 0, your final sum will be 343.33+175 = 518.33 points. Comparatively, if the other players contribute 20, their sums will be 395+175 = 570 points and 372.67+175 = 547.67 points. \n\nTo guarantee your win, you might have to contribute slightly more points than expected. Let's say you contribute 30 points. Then your final sum will be 313.33+175 = 488.33 points. If the others contribute 20, their sums will be 375+175 = 550 and 352.67+175 = 527.67.\n\nSo, it seems it is difficult for you to guarantee a win in the final round no matter how much you contribute, considering the contributions made by other players in past rounds. But to maximize your communal return while keeping your contribution minimal, you could contribute around 15 points.\n\nSo, \"I contribute 15 points\"."]}, "Player C": {"score": 441, "moves": [20, 20, 17, 16, 16], "text_moves": ["I contribute 20.", "I contribute 20.", "I contribute 17.", "I contribute 16.", "I contribute 16."]}, "agents": ["Player A", "Player B", "Player C"], "n_rounds": 5}
